## Brief description of the project:
   The problem is the accurate diagnosis of breast masses as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using computed features from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA). The features consist of radius, texture,  perimeter,  area, smoothness, compactness,  concavity, concave.points, symmetry, and fractal_dimension of the mass, and there mean, worst, and standard error(SE).
    
   The goal is to predict the nature of breast tumors based on the analyzed features, enabling medical professionals to make informed decisions regarding patient treatment and care.

   Solving the problem of diagnosing breast cancer is important because it can lead to early detection, appropriate treatment plans, improved survival rates, and optimal allocation of healthcare resources.
