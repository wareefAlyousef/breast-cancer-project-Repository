 ## This dataset aims to aid in diagnosing breast cancer. By analyzing the computed features of cell nuclei, the dataset enables researchers and data scientists to develop models and algorithms for accurately distinguishing between malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) breast masses. The dataset is a valuable resource for data mining and machine learning techniques applied to breast cancer classification.
