# breast-cancer-project

##The goal of this dataset is to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer. By analyzing the computed features of cell nuclei, the dataset enables researchers and data scientists to develop models and algorithms for accurately distinguishing between malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) breast masses. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for data mining and machine learning techniques applied to breast cancer classification.
